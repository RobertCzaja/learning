1. 
	When after merge develop/master to feature branch i want to revert this operation.

2.
	When make a commit and try to revert this commit but i want to changes in files remains as 
	"new code". 
		1. When commits were not pushed to remote branch 
		2. When comits were pushed to remote branch  

3. 
	When i do my feature shit but i realise that I'm on develop branch (with a few commits - not pushed):
	* move changes to new branch: `git checkout -b new-feature-branch`
	* remove changes from develop: `git reset --hard HEAD~2` (when two new commits has been created)
	* checks if everything it's ok: git log --oneline -5

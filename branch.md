	When branch that you want to remove has unique commits... just read this sentences from the Stack Overflow:
	"It means the branch you are about to delete contains commits that are not reachable from any of: its upstream branch, or HEAD (currently checked out revision). In other words, when you might lose commitsÂ¹."

git push origin --delete branch-name-1
	REMOTE

git branch -vv
	To display mapping local branches with remote branches

git branch feature/1234 develop
	when you are on the branch feature/123123 but you want to create new one which base on different branch.

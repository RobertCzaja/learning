1. How to change last commit message (amend),
2. When "add" some files but i want to that files become "red" again

	git reset HEAD some_file_name.txt

3. When make "green" files with some changes but current branch is master and that's should be 
   one feature branch - you need to checkout to this feature branch and make a commit. Master 
   will not contain it anymore.
